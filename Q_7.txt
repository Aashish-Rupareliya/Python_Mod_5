Explain what does django-admin.py make messages command is used for?

The django-admin.py makemessages command is used in Django to create message files for translation, 
which are necessary for internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) of your Django application. 
This command scans your codebase for strings marked for translation and generates or updates message files (.po files) that 
can be used by translators to provide translations for different languages.
